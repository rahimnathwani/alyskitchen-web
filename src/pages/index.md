  title: Introducing Aly’s Lunchbox
  description: >-
    We are a family with a passion for cooking and helping others. Charity has a
    very important role not only in our religion, but also in society. This is
    our small way of giving back and showing our gratitude to the blessings we
    have been given by Allah. We will be keeping you up to date on our projects,
    so please do show your support by liking, following and sharing!


    Our current project is giving out homemade food boxes to our local key workers, as they have been working non stop since the start of this pandemic to help us all. Having key workers of our own in the family, we know what a good home cooked meal means during a gruelling 12 hour shift!
description: Meet Aly. Born and raised in Uganda, he came from humble beginnings
  and worked very hard to provide his best for his family. He was a loving
  husband, father, grandfather and friend to many and was known especially in
  the Manor Park area as the local postmaster - serving for over 35 years!  In
  January 2020, he suddenly passed away (may Allah have Mercy on him and grant
  him Jannat al-Firdous, ameen) and our world shattered. So much has happened
  since then, with many loved ones lost around the world and we wanted to put
  our efforts into something positive that will not only help others, but
  hopefully be an act of sadqah jariyah (ongoing charity) for him.  Everything
  we are able to do as a family after Allah first and foremost, is due to him.
  He loved us, raised us, nurtured us and taught us the importance of helping
  others and giving back. He gave us everything and more in his lifetime, so now
  is our time to give it back with Aly’s Lunchbox.  Fresh, Halal food,
  Homecooked with love

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
